# Deposit Process

This post will explain the depositing process and each of the phases.  
  
Before we start, to understand the basic idea of how Ethereum 2.0 keys work, the [Ethereum 2.0 Keys](https://kb.beaconcha.in/ethereum-2-keys) blog is highly recommended.

## The deposit contract

Let's go through each of the **states** above and explain how their **durations** are approximately determined.

## **1. Mempool - Status: Unknown**

Every signed transaction visits the **Mempool** first, which can be referred to as the waiting room for transactions. During this period, the _transaction status_ is [_pending_](https://etherscan.io/txsPending).   
Depending on the chosen **gas fee** for the transaction, miners pick the ones that return them the most value first. If the network is highly congested \(=many pending transactions\), there's a high chance that new transactions will outbid\(gas fees\) older transactions, leading to **unknown** waiting times.

## 2. Deposit contract - Status: Deposited

Once the transaction reaches the **deposit contract,** the deposit contract checks the transaction for its **Input data** and **value.**   
If the **threshold** of 1 ETH is not met or the transaction has **no/invalid** input data, the transaction will get **rejected** and returned to the sender.

{% hint style="info" %}
The user-created **input data** is a reflection of the upcoming **validator and withdrawal keys** on the Ethereum 2.0 network as seen in the picture below. The full Ethereum 2.0 keys blog is [here](https://kb.beaconcha.in/ethereum-2-keys).
{% endhint %}

#### **Why exactly does this take at least 12 hours?**

The Ethereum 2.0 chain only considers transactions which have been in the deposit contract for at least 2048  Ethereum 1.0 blocks to ensure they never end up in a [reorged](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Chain_Reorganization) block. **\(=**`ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE`**\)**  
  
In addition to the 2048 Ethereum 1.0 blocks, 32 **Ethereum 2.0** [**Epochs**](https://kb.beaconcha.in/glossary#epoch) ****must be ****awaited before the beacon-chain recognises the deposit. During these 32 Epochs, validators vote on newly received deposits.   
  
However, [missed block](https://kb.beaconcha.in/glossary#block-status) proposals or bad Ethereum 1.0 nodes, which provide the deposit logs to the Ethereum 2.0 network can cause longer waiting times.   
Therefore, run your [own node](https://kb.beaconcha.in/run-a-goerli-node-eth1-and-beaconnode-eth2)!  
  
**2048 blocks** = 2048 x 14 seconds = 28,672 seconds = **~8 hours**  
**32 Epochs** = 32 x 6.4 minutes =  204.8 minutes = **~3.5 hours**

Once the deposit is in the deposit contract, the state of the validator will switch to _**Deposited**_ on the [beaconcha.in](https://mainnet.beaconcha.in/validator/0xa40fa34c70f5958524a45c748b4054dda3add825fb37b7614eba1796da31ea73891a69dfddf823409230f78e7fc9b10d) explorer.

## 3. Validator Queue - Status: Pending

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28108%29.png)

The deposit is accessible now for the beacon-chain. Depending on the amount of total deposits, the validators have to wait in a queue. Four validators per [Epoch](https://kb.beaconcha.in/glossary#epoch) \(**900 validators per day\)** can get activated.

## 4. Staking - Status: Active

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28112%29.png)

The validator is now actively staking. It is proposing blocks and signing attestations - ready to earn ETH!

## Other validator status



#### Deposit Invalid

The transaction had an invalid [BLS](https://kb.beaconcha.in/ethereum-2-keys#general) signature.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28110%29.png)

#### Active Offline

An active validator has not been attesting for at least two epochs.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28117%29.png)

#### Exiting Online

The validator **is online** and currently exiting the network because either its **balance dropped below 16ETH \(forced exit\)** or the **exit was requested** **\(voluntary exit\)** by the validator.

#### Exiting Offline 

The validator **is offline** and currently exiting the network because either its **balance dropped below 16ETH** or the **exit was requested** by the validator.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28103%29.png)

#### Slashing Online

The validator **is online** but was malicious and therefore forced to **exit** the network.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28105%29.png)

#### Slashing Offline 

The validator **is offline** and was malicious and which lead to a forced to exit out of the network.   
The validator is currently in the exiting queue with a minimum of 25 minutes.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28114%29.png)

#### Slashed

The validator has been kicked out of the network. The funds will be withdrawable after 36 days.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28106%29.png)

#### Exited

The validator has exited the network. The funds will be withdrawable after 1 day.
